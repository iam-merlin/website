Kubernetes (commonly stylized as k8s) is an open-source container orchestration system for automating application deployment, scaling, and management. 

<br />

It was originally designed by Google, and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. It aims to provide a "platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts".
 
<br />

It works with a range of container tools, including Docker.

<br />
  
Many cloud services offer a Kubernetes-based platform or infrastructure as a service (PaaS or IaaS) on which Kubernetes can be deployed as a platform-providing service. Many vendors also provide their own branded Kubernetes distributions.
